# DFS and BFS Comparison in Python
The comparison will be done on the basis of length of the final path, length of the search path and the execution time plus the discussion on the memory complexit.

### BFS (Breath First Search):
``` 
from BFSfile import BFS
```
[Breadth-First Search](https://favtutor.com/blogs/breadth-first-search-python#:~:text=Breadth%2DFirst%20Search%20is%20a,graph%20is%20almost%20the%20same.) is a recursive algorithm to search all the vertices of a graph or a tree. BFS in python can be implemented by using data structures like a dictionary and lists. Breadth-First Search in tree and graph is almost the same.

### DFS (Depth First Search):
```
from DFSFile import DFS
```
Traversal means that visiting all the nodes of a graph which can be done through Depth-first search or Breadth-first search in python. Depth-first traversal or [Depth-first Search](https://favtutor.com/blogs/depth-first-search-python#:~:text=Traversal%20means%20that%20visiting%20all,graph%20or%20tree%20data%20structure.) is an algorithm to look at all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure.

### Pyamaze:
```
from pyamaze import maze,agent,COLOR,textLabel
```
The module pyamaze is created for the easy generation of random maze and apply different search algorithm efficiently. The main idea of this module, pyamaze, is to assist in creating customizable random mazes and be able to work on that, like applying the search algorithm with much ease.

### Timeit:
```
from timeit import timeit
```
Python timeit() is a method in Python library to measure the execution time taken by the given code snippet. The Python library runs the code statement 1 million times and provides the minimum time taken from the given set of code snippets.
